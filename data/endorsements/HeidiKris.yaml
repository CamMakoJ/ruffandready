quote: We love Ruff n Ready raw dog food. We have a Stafford Terrier, Stanley, who has food and skin allergies and Ruff n Ready has eliminated his food allergies. With Ruff n Ready we know exactly what we are getting in his food as there’s no added ingredients. We supplement with veggies and sweet potatoes and Stanley has never looked better. Stanley’s skin has also benefited from the salmon as it makes his fur and skin less dry. We recommend Ruff n Ready to anyone who is looking for a raw dog food!
