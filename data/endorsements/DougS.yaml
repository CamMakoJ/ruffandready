quote: For the past three months, I have been feeding our 2 German Shepherds Ruff N’ Ready Chicken, Beef & Salmon and believe it is one of the best (if not the best) raw food product on the market.  We have tried at least 5 different raw food brands with limited success. Our dogs have responded extremely well to Ruff N’ Ready raw dog food. Many other brands appear to have a fair amount of water, which is quite evident when you thaw out the food. Ruff N’ Ready does not. The food is easy to handle (as it comes in individual patties and resealable bags). In my view, as noted above, Ruff N’ Ready is the best raw dog food on the market and very reasonably priced.  I can’t say enough good things about the product and highly recommend it to anyone who feeds raw to their dogs.
